abstract: "According to Lisjak, Lee, and Gardner (2012), a threat to a brand can elicit the same response as a threat to the self. The current research examined whether people react differently to brand threats as a function of East Asian versus North American culture and as a function of whether the source of the threat was a stranger or a close friend. In Study 1, 616 U.S. and East Asian participants were recruited to complete an online survey via Amazon’s M Turk. Participants were asked to read a blog post that contains negative evaluations of two U.S. brands. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions, in which they were either told that the blog post was written by a close friend or by a stranger. After reading, participants’ attitude change towards the brands was measured to reflect their defensiveness. Results show that there was no significant difference in defensiveness between East Asian and U.S. participants in either condition. Study 2 was then conducted to examine Chinese responses to Chinese brands assessed in their native language. In Study 2, 500 Chinese participants completed the study in Mandarin, and the survey included Chinese as well as American brands. Participants showed no significant difference in their defensiveness on brands from China versus the U.S. Overall, no evidence was found to support the cultural differences in consumers’ defensiveness when a brand they identify with is threatened."# scribd embed

#### Introduction: Brand Identification
**Brand identification:**
- The more one favors a brand, the more one identifies with a brand, and therefore the more behavioral commitments one makes to that brand [^1]
- When consumers perceive negative evaluations of a brand, those with stronger self-brand connections tend to evaluate the brand less negatively [^2][^3]

**Lisjak, Lee, & Gardner (2012):**
- People with high self-brand connections would defend the brand “to preserve the integrity of the self”[^4]
- Measured brand identification on Facebook and Starbucks
- Let participants read editorials that criticized the two brands
- Measured attitude change after reading
- People with higher level of brand identification defended the brands more strongly

**Culture and self-expression**
- People’s tastes are less easily swayed by social pressure in Western countries than in East Asian countries [^5]

#### Goal of the Study
- **Replicate Lisjak, Lee & Gardner (2012)’s finding in East Asian cultural context and on other brands**
- **Explore if consumers’ response can differ when a threat to the brand is carried by friends vs strangers, and if the effect can be moderated by culture**

#### Study 1
##### Hypotheses
- Participants from East Asian countries would be less defensive than participants from the U.S. when negative evaluation of a brand comes from a close friend vs a stranger
- Exploratory: Mobile phone brands vs Clothing brands

##### Method
- Around 500 participants from Amazon’s M Turk
- East Asian vs USA
- Close friend vs Stranger
- Mobile phone (iPhone) vs Clothing brand (Nike)
- Measured brand identification on the Self-Brand Connection Scale[^6] (⍺ = .86)
- Stranger vs. Close friend condition
- Measured pre-reading attitude
- Read a fabricated blog post
- Measured attitude change for defensiveness

##### Results
- High Brand Identification lead to higher defensiveness
- No effect of information agent/culture
- Main effect of brand category on defensiveness
- Marginal interaction between culture and information agent for the clothing brand ONLY

#### Study 2
##### Study 1 Limitations
- Survey language & Brand origin

##### Hypotheses
When Chinese participants’ brand identification is threatened, they would more strongly defend:
- Chinese brands than American brands
- When information is carried by a stranger than when it is carried by a close friend
- Exploratory: Mobile phone brands vs Clothing brands

##### Method
- Around 500 participants from China
- Added two Chinese brands, Li-Ning and Huawei
- Same survey and measures as in Study 1
- Survey translated into Mandarin (⍺ = .91)

##### Results
- _High Brand Identification lead to higher defensiveness_
- No effect of brand origin/information agent
- Main effect of brand category on defensiveness
- Unexpected three-way interaction

#### Conclusions
- **Supported the potential cultural generalizability by replicating the finding of Lisjak, Lee, and Gardner (2012)**
- Did not support the notion that defensive responses differ when a threat to the brand is carried by friends versus strangers, nor that this difference can be moderated by culture
- **Culture may not have as strong an impact on brand identification and brand defense as we expected**

##### Limitations
- The demographic representativeness of the sample
- The relatively impoverished manipulation of information agent
- Nature of the brands

#### Implications
Commercial brands are different in how easily they can be incorporated into the extended-self:
- Frequency of usage
- Degree of Individualization
- Privacy
Possibility of identity globalization:
- Chinese consumption culture may be more individualized than we expected
- Further studies can be done in exploring the psychology of globalization and its potential effect on consumer behavior in East Asian countries
