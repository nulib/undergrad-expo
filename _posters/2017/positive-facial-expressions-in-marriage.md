abstract: "Marital emotional functioning is one of the most important predictors of marital outcomes (e.g., marital satisfaction), which in turn has important consequences for well¬≠being and health factors for both spouses and their children. Thus far, negative emotions (e.g., anger) have been the central focus in distinguishing dissatisfied from satisfied couples (i.e., low and high marital satisfaction). In sharp contrast, positive emotions have rarely been the target of empirical marital research, notwithstanding the sizeable body of research garnered showing a myriad of cognitive, social, psychological, and physical benefits positive emotions hold for individuals (i.e., broadenand¬≠build theory of positive emotions). Thus, the present study examined a potentially important aspect of marital emotional functioning: the experience of positive emotion via displays of positive facial expression (i.e., genuine and nongenuine smiles), and associations with marital satisfaction. Marital satisfaction was expected to be positively associated with the display of genuine smiles, but not the display of nongenuine smiles. In a sample of 66 married spouses (33 couples), participants‚Äô facial expressions were videotaped during pleasant and conflict conversations. Smiles were coded as either genuine or non¬≠genuine based on the Facial Action Coding System on a second¬≠by¬≠second coding basis for the first three minutes of both conversations (interrater agreement: k= .93¬≠1). Marital satisfaction was measured using the Marital Adjustment Test questionnaire (15 items; a= .8). Results showed that there was no association between the frequency of both genuine (inconsistent with hypothesis) and nongenuine (consistent with hypothesis) smiles and marital satisfaction. Follow¬≠up exploratory analyses showed a positive association between the frequency of genuine smiles and positive emotional experiences (i.e., amusement) during both conversations, consistent with previous findings of a positive association between genuine smiles and emotional well¬≠being. Limitations (e.g., small sample size), implications, and future directions are discussed."

#### Background
- Marital emotional functioning is an important predictor of marital satisfaction [^1]
- Positive emotions play an important role in social relationships [^2], but few studies have examined positive emotions in marriage

#### The Present Study
- Examined an aspect of positive marital emotional functioning via displays of positive facial expressions (i.e., genuine and nongenuine smiles) during marital interactions and their
associations with marital satisfaction
- Hypothesized positive association between genuine (but not non-genuine) smiles and marital satisfaction

#### Method

##### Participants
- N = 66 married spouses from Chicago area from highly diverse backgrounds
- Age: M = 42.77, SD = 9.3
- Household income: M = $72.5K, SD = $< $27.5K, range: < 20K to >150K (n=6)
- Education (in years): M=15.08, SD=2.79

##### Measures and Procedure
- Smiles were measured as spouses engaged in unrehearsed 10-minute conversations about (1) a pleasant topic (i.e., positive conversation) and (2) a topic of disagreement (i.e., conflict
conversation) (in counterbalanced order)
- Amusement experience was measured after each conversation using an emotion checklist (i.e., 0 = no amusement at all; 8 = strongest amusement ever felt)
- Marital satisfaction was measured using the Marital Adjustment Test (i.e., 15 items, ùõº = .8; e.g., ‚ÄúTo what extent do you and your mate agree or disagree on demonstration of affection?‚Äù)

#### Genuine and Non-Genuine Smiles Coding

![Figure 1](/assets/images/2017/positive-facial-1.png)
_Action Unit 6: Cheek Raiser, Action Unit 12: Lip Corner Puller_

- Two trained coders objectively coded genuine and non-genuine smiles based on the Facial Action Coding System (Œ∫ = .93-1) on a second-by-second basis for the first 3-minutes of each conversation.
- Genuine smile was defined as contraction of (1) action unit (AU) 6 (i.e., cheek raiser) and (2) AU 12 (i.e., lip corner raise).
- Non-genuine smile was defined as contraction of only AU 12
- To take into account that smiles were coded during a conversation, we included two covariate codes: (1) talking and (2) laughing.

#### Results
**Preliminary Analyses**

|  | 1. | 2. |3. | 4. | 5. |
| 1. Genuine smiles: Conflict conversation | - | .50*** | .27* | .16 | .36** |
| 2. Non-Genuine smiles: Conflict conversation | - | - | .57*** | .51*** | -.06 |
| 3. Genuine smiles: Positive conversation | - | - | - | .44*** | .29* |
| 4. Non-genuine smiles: Positive conversation | - | - | - | - | .36**

_Note. *p<.05. **p < .01. ***p < .001._

Results indicated no significant correlations between smiles (genuine and non-genuine) and marital satisfaction, regardless of conversation context. Results held controlling for talking and laughing.

#### Exploratory Analyses

#### Discussion
- Findings do not support link between smiles during marital conversations and marital satisfaction
- Exploratory analyses support positive link between smiles (in particular genuine smiles) and positive emotional experiences during marital conversations
- Study has limitations, which suggest directions for future research, including increasing sample size to afford sufficient statistical power to detect mediumsized effects; expanding smiles coding to capture >2 action units for >3 minutes; and accounting for statistical interdependence between spouses
- Findings guide us in continuing to examine how positive emotional expressions fit into the larger body of positive emotion research
