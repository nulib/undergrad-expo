abstract: "Approximately 1 in 3 deaths in the US is caused by cardiovascular diseases, among them atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis occurs through excessive cholesterol deposition (hyperlipidemia) along the inner layer of the artery called the intima, resulting in plaque formation that blocks arterial blood flow and could lead to heart attacks and strokes. It has recently been recognized that inflammation plays an important role in plaque formation. Specifically, T cell activation can affect the progression of atherosclerosis through interaction with antigen presenting cells (APCs) in a hyperlipidemic environment. APCs ingest foreign objects and present digested remnants on antigen presenting molecules at the cell surface and these complexes are recognized by T cells. Unlike common peptide antigen presenting molecules, group 1 CD1 molecules present both self and pathogenic lipids to T cells. This study looks at the unknown role of lipid antigen presenting molecules, specifically CD1b and CD1c subset molecules, on atherosclerotic plaque formation around the intima of hearts in new mice models: control LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLrko), LDL receptor knockout mice with hCD1 transgene (hCD1Tg/LDLrko), LDL receptor and CD1d knockout mice with hCD1 transgene (hCD1Tg/CD1dko/LDLrko), and LDL receptor inactivated mice with hCD1and HJ1 transgenes (hCD1Tg/ HJ1Tg/LDLrko).The results of this study indicate that hCD1Tg/CD1dko/LDLrko group had the highest plaque area with an average of 1,268,144.03 +/- 196,133.22 um2. Compared to the control mouse strain (LDLrko) with an average plaque area of 920,032.71 +/- 176,399.84 um2, both hCD1Tg/LDLrko and hCD1Tg/ HJ1Tg/LDLrko mice had lower average plaque areas (816,594.55 +/- 292,567.95 and 555,188.84 +/- 171,016.61 um2, respectively). One-way ANOVA and Turkey post-hoc statistical tests were performed using Prism Software. It is unclear whether the HJ1 T cell receptors were activated by the amount of plaque upon the end of the 12-week high fat diet period. Further research with an extended high fat diet period (16-18 weeks) can determine whether HJ1 T cell receptors are activated in hyperlipidemic mice. Future clinical uses of this research may include manipulating the group 1 CD1-restricted T cells to control heart plaque formation and, possibly, preventing atherosclerosis and heart attacks."

## Results

The results of this study indicate that hCD1Tg/CD1dko/LDLrko group had the highest plaque area with an average of 1.26x106 um2. Compared to the control mouse strain (LDLrko) with
an average plaque area of 9.20x105 um2, both hCD1Tg/LDLrko and hCD1Tg/ HJ1Tg/LDLrko mice had lower average plaque areas (8.16x105 and 5.55x105 um2, respectively). One-way ANOVA and Turkey post-hoc statistical tests were performed. Plaque comparison by sex was also performed.

## Future Research and Significance

Future research with an extended high fat diet period (16-18 weeks) can determine whether HJ1 T cell receptors are activated in hyperlipidemic mice. Clinical uses of this research may include manipulating group 1 CD1-restricted T cells to control heart plaque formation and, possibly, preventing atherosclerosis and heart attacks.

## Summary

- Significant unexpected difference in plaque areas between the control mice (LDLrko) and mice with CD1b-restricted T cells (hCD1Tg/HJ1Tg/LDLrko).
- Overexpressing CD1b-restricted T cells (HJ1Tg) decreased plaque count. This refutes the initial hypothesis that CD1b-restricted T cells (HJ1Tg) would
increase plaque area.
- Possibly due to inactivation of HJ1 T cells.
- Significant difference between control (LDLrko) and hCD1Tg/LDLrko mice.
- hCD1Tg mice do not harbor CD1b and CD1c-restricted T cells.
- hCD1Tg/LDLrko has lower plaque area than hCD1Tg/CD1dko/LDLrko mice
- CD1d-restricted T cells (i.e. NKT cells) may have an inhibitory effect on CD1c and CD1b-restricted T cell activation or function.
- Unclear whether males usually have a greater plaque formation than females.
