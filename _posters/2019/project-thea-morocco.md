abstract: "Women in developing countries occupy a unique role in the economy that is often underappreciated, informal and highly vital to the countryâ€™s economic stability. Despite their high productivity and output, women in countries such as Morocco lack support from their government and communities as well as the infrastructure necessary to develop and grow their businesses. Project Thea: Morocco addresses a current gap in the literature on the specific environment women in Morocco face. To answer this question, I conducted a field study by speaking with several organizations and women in Marrakech and Rabat to gain a more nuanced understanding of the business climate. Additionally, I built on and corroborated my findings with the help of peer-reviewed journal articles. My research found an astounding lack of support from the Moroccan government and a generally unwelcoming business environment for female entrepreneurs. My paper further confirms the notion that more infrastructure must be established in developing countries in order to empower the economic leaders of tomorrow."
