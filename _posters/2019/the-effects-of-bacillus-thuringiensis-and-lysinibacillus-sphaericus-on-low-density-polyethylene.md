abstract: "The purpose of this research is to determine and compare the rates that Bacillus thuringiensis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, and a composite of the two degrade low-density polyethylene, the leading plastic pollutant in the world. The research involved measuring the mass of low-density polyethylene degraded by B. thuringiensis, L. sphaericus, and a composite of the two. The bacteria agars were inoculated to make a bacterial broth of each culture. Samples of LDPE were exposed individually to 10mL of B. thuringiensis broth, 10mL of L. sphaericus broth, and 5mL of each broth together for the composite for nine days. Six separate but identical trials were executed during the experimentation period, and all were subjected to the same environment within an incubator at 30oC. The masses of all samples were measured and compared to respective masses before exposure to the bacterial broths to calculate mass degradation. The research and subsequent data obtained present the conclusion that the bacterial composite has a significantly greater degradation rate on LDPE than the B. thuringiensis and L. sphaericus independently, hence supporting the initial hypothesis. The data furthermore showed there was an insignificant difference in degradation rates between B. thuringiensis and L. sphaericus individually. The results propose the potential of further developing more effective compositions of microorganisms to degrade polyethylene beyond the rate at which the composite examined in this research in order to reduce global plastic pollution that plagues the environment."
