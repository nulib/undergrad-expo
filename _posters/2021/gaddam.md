    Homeless Menstruation: A Construction Of Embodied Experiences and a Breakdown of Amplified Psychosocial Issues
date: 2021-05-24
abstract: "Homelessness and menstruation are constructs and processes that are plagued with stigma. For decades, academics have researched menstruation and homelessness as separately stigmatized experiences. However, in the process, scholars have overlooked the converging and intersectional nature of the stigma surrounding homeless menstruation. Through library research and records, this paper analyzes in what ways menstrual stigma and homeless stigma coincide to exacerbate detrimental psychosocial issues faced by homeless menstruators. The result was the identification of seven converging psychosocial experiences: phenomenology, objectification, self-regulation, media portrayal, morale, mental illness, and intersectionality. By comparing, contrasting, and analyzing these overlapping stigmas, this paper will paint a basic picture of the experience of homeless menstruation.Stigma, at its root, is a construct that sets people apart from the status quo and brands people as disgusting (Goffman). Therefore, an understanding of the social degradation endured due to the amplified stigma surrounding this vulnerable group, would allow communities to start taking the needed steps to alleviate the social alienation of homeless menstruators. In other words, the amplified stigma experienced by homeless menstruators drives their day-to-day life and societal placement; therefore, comprehension of this converging stigma is crucial for enacting systemic social change that improves the lives of homeless menstruators."
