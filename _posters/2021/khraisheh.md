    Experts have recognized the potential for religion to shape environmental attitudes. In recent decades, the world has seen the rise of faith-based organizations in tackling issues of sustainability, particularly those following Islamic ecotheology. Embedded in Islamic scripture is an emphasis on responsibility and accountability towards the Earth; Islamic environmental organizations have capitalized on such teachings to inspire action in Muslim communities. In my research paper, I explored the following question: how are environmental organizations, operating in Western countries with a clear Muslim identity, using religion to encourage environmental sustainability? I chose to focus on Islam as it is the worldâ€™s second-largest and fastest-growing religion. I selected four of the most successful Islamic environmental organizations in the West: Green Muslims, Faithfully Sustainable, Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences, and Khaleafa. I analyzed each organization based on three factors: target audience, strategy, and use of religion. Similarities included the use of Muslim traditions and celebrations (i.e. Ramadan and Eid), the use of stewardship to highlight individual responsibility towards the Earth, and the provision of educational resources regarding Islamic environmentalism. The primary differences were their target audiences, the nature of their projects, their use of social media, and their use of religion on their websites and social media platforms. The eco-Islam movement will continue to grow, alongside the rise of faith-based environmental organizations associated with other religions. Learning the most effective way to utilize religion to inspire eco-friendly behavior is becoming increasingly important as we continue to face exigent environmental threats.
