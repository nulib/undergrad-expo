title: Irish Language Revitalization in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
date: 2021-05-24
abstract: The revitalization of endangered languages is both deeply personal and political, as language subjugation is directly linked to intentional efforts by colonizing powers to suppress and eradicate indigenous culture and dismantle local collective identity. Many studies have been conducted on how to promote endangered languages, but few evaluate the effectiveness of the movements and explore the underlying determinants of success, particularly how the relationship between minority language speakers and the colonizing powers may affect these movements. The Irish language revitalization movements in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland serve as a particularly valuable case study of the role of anti-colonial cultural movements especially as they relate to language; the Republic of Ireland is an independent country, while Northern Ireland is still part of the United Kingdom. Despite state-support for Irish language revitalization, census data shows that the Republic of Ireland saw a decrease in the percentage of speakers in all 26 counties from 2001 to 2011. On the other hand, the percentage of Irish speakers during this time in Northern Ireland increased in half of the counties, and decreased at a lower rate in the remaining counties. This research explores how nationalism drives language revitalization movements, and how the stage of decolonization determines its success. I argue that the presence of an identity conflict between colonizer and colonized increases the efficacy of language revitalization movements, as language is a component used to establish a separate identity and assert independence from a colonizer.
