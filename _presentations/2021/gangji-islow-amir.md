title: ChangEd Digital Marketing Strategy
date: 2021-05-24
abstract: "This project aimed to create a well-rounded digital marketing strategy for ChangEd, a student loan repayment application. We were tasked with improving the awareness, engagement, and consideration, areas the application needed to improve on. \n\n We created a digital and social media marketing strategy using primary research we conducted with their target audience (graduates, current students, and parents), suggesting ways to improve current paid and earned media, as well as introduce new approaches using our insights and learning in class.\n\nThrough our research, we found that more than half of U.S. students apply for student loans and are under extreme pressure to find a high-paying job to repay the loan. Student loan repayment applications are not popular among the group and more than half of the respondents did not use any application. In our project, we concluded that student loan applications can help people manage and repay their student loans faster. We based our recommendations and campaign on this. \n\nThe project includes suggestions for social media as well as their website, search engine optimization, and search engine marketing. We also planned out the cost, and how these would be implemented and evaluated in the campaign period.\n\nApplications like ChangEd are useful because graduates struggle with repayment because of other obligations. Student loan applications make this manageable. The parents of these students can also use these applications to contribute to repaying the loan. Our project conveys this information effectively to the target audience using digital and social media. "
