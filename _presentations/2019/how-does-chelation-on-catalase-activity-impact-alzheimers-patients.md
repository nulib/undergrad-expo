abstract: "Alzheimer’s disease is caused by the build up of various metal ions. These metal ions start to build up on the brain’s neurons. The build up of these metal ions start to create a protein that is known as Tau protein. The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate the effects of metal ions, EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and turmeric on catalase activity. Also, to inhibit catalase function on neurons. The hypothesis for the experiment was if the turmeric curcumin extract is the chelating agent in the Aluminium sulfate then the filter paper soaked in the catalase solution will reach to the surface the fastest. This is because the turmeric curcumin will allow oxygen molecules to reach the surface the fastest which results in less time for the filter paper to float to the surface. The hypothesis was supported by the data. According to the results, this hypothesis was proven to be correct. The chelating agent, Turmeric Curcumin on the metal ion, Aluminium Sulfate was the most efficient in increasing catalase activity. In the groups, 2/3 of the metal ions met this standard. The other 1/3 distilled water was the most efficient for Calcium Sulfate. As Calcium Sulfate has different properties compared to the other metal ions the time differed and different chelating agents worked better towards Calcium Sulfate. The distilled water in the Aluminium Sulfate, took a long time for catalase activity to occur. The EDTA in the Copper Sulfate took the longest time to show the catalase activity reaction. Likewise, the EDTA in Magnesium Sulfate took the least amount of time for catalase activity to occur in that test. The scientific explanation for the results is that each neuron in the brain has its own function; the functions are different ways of sending signals throughout the body. When plaque and tangles are formed it causes the neurons to relinquish and fail to send signals. These are formed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and metal ions. Due to some possible human and mechanical errors, the results of this experiment might slightly vary. The readings of the weight may have had very little variance.  A higher quality weighing scale could be used to eliminate this possible error. Some attempts to minimize errors in this experiment include having the same amount of each liquid in beaker 1 (H2O2 and H2O). These steps gave the same conditions for each beaker, keeping environmental errors to a limit. If the experiment were conducted again, there are many possibilities to develop it further by using different metal ions or by increasing the amount of concentration of the chelating agents. Another change would be to observe the effect of beta-amyloid proteins. This could relate to how the brain would be impacted by the different chemicals. This experiment proved that Alzheimer’s disease, a growing threat to the world. In many families, Alzheimer’s disease has been changing the lives of many, in ways that are despairing. It is a distressing process for caretakers and patients going through Alzheimer’s."
