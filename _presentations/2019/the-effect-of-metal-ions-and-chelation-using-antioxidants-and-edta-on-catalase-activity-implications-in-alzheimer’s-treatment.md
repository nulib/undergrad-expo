abstract: "Purpose: To determine the inhibitive properties of metal ions on catalase activity as well as to determine which antioxidant most effectively diminishes the inhibitory effect of the most inhibitive metal on catalase activity through chelation and compare it to a synthetic chelator, EDTA. Procedure: Set up a gas-collecting apparatus. For Part 1, to determine which metal inhibits catalase the most, test H2O2 alone for negative control, test catalase for positive control, catalase + copper, catalase + iron, catalase + zinc, catalase + aluminum, and catalase + lead. Perform three trials. For Part 2, mix the most inhibitive metal as determined in Part 1 with catalase, then add either EDTA, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, or vitamin E to allow chelation. Add the catalase-metal ion-natural chelator mixture into the flask with H2O2. Measure the volume of oxygen produced after five minutes. Perform three trials. Conclusion: According to this experiment, Vitamin E and Ascorbic Acid provides the most amount of protection from catalase inhibition via metals which is beneficial in reducing chances of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease caused by oxidative stress. Furthermore, avoiding excess copper intake also helps catalase efficiency to decompose hydrogen peroxide before it produces radicals and oxidative stress."
