abstract: "In the Marvel Comics series Moon Knight, a mercenary believes an ancient Egyptian deity has brought him back from the dead so he can become the eponymous superhero. However, the mercenary’s symptoms of schizophrenia suggest he is instead simply suffering from a psychological break. From 1975-1999, Moon Knight stories used this psychological-religious tension to explore the significance of mythology and religion in modern society. For my research, I examined the way Moon Knight stories represent these religious themes relative to the work of religious scholars such as Mircea Eliade, who claimed that we live in a completely rational, post-mythic society. I also interviewed character co-creator and series writer Doug Moench, whose personal experiences with the supernatural influenced his writing of the character. Through my research I found that Moench’s Moon Knight stories argue that mythology and religion are alive and well in today’s society, though they may appear in less traditional forms. This project ultimately supports contemporary research that claims seemingly secular popular culture in fact serves as a modern form of religious expression."
