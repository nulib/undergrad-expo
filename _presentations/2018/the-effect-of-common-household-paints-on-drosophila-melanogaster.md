abstract: "Purpose:  The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of common household paints, and the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that they contain, on Drosophila melanogaster. Previous research has demonstrated a correlation between VOCs in paint and the development of conditions like asthma in humans, as well as to disruptions to the central nervous system. Procedure:  Three different paints were tested for harmful effects on Drosophila melanogaster. Four experimental groups were prepared: a control, a Rust-Oleum spray paint, a Rust-Oleum Topcoat, and a low VOC Behr Marquee. Each group contained 5 vials (for a total of 20 vials), and each vial contained 5 male and 5 female fruit flies. In groups where the flies were exposed to paint fumes, the top 4 cm. of the vial were painted. Three metrics were used to assess damage: climbing ability for neurological damage; number of larvae for reproductive harm; and larvae burrowing behavior for respiratory damage. Climbing ability was measured before paint exposure, at two weeks, and at four weeks. Number of larvae and larvae burrowing behavior was measured at two weeks. Conclusion:  It was concluded that flies exposed to paint fumes from any of the three paints showed damage in all measured categories. Flies exposed to the Rust-Oleum Topcoat group consistently exhibited the most damage, while the low VOC Behr Marquee group suffered the least damage. The flies in the control group, however, did not show any damage in any of the categories observed. From these outcomes, it can be concluded that exposure to common household paints leads to various forms of damage in fruit flies. Based on the results of this research, along with that of previous studies, it is likely that the VOCs in the paint contributed to these various damages."
