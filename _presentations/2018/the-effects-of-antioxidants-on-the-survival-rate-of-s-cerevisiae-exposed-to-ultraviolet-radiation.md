abstract: "Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of antioxidant protection against UVB radiation and to determine which antioxidants out of Ascorbic Acid, Zinc Oxide, and Vitamin E most effectively prevent UVB radiation from damaging cells as well as to design an in-vitro model that can help test the ultraviolet absorbing capabilities of different natural antioxidants. Procedure: Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model organism in this project as they have a similar anatomy and physiology compared to human skin cells. They were dissolved in sugar water with different antioxidants, incubated, and placed under UVB radiation. Viability rates of the cells were calculated. Conclusion: The experimental data partially supported the first hypothesis. The results showed, based on the viability rates calculated, that Zinc Oxide was indeed significantly more effective at protecting the cells against radiation compared to Vitamin E; however, Zinc Oxide and Ascorbic Acid are not significantly different from each other in their protective capabilities against UVB radiation. The second hypothesis of this project was supported. All the cultures that are tested with antioxidants indeed did have higher viability rates in some
degree compared to the positive control and had lower viability rates compared to the negative control."
