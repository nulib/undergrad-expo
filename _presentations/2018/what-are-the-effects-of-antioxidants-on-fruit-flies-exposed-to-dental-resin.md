abstract: "Purpose: What are the effects of antioxidants on the climbing abilities of fruit flies exposed to dental resin?  
Research: Free radicals are highly reactive particles containing unpaired electrons in their valence shells and seek to fill in empty spaces within their valence shells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) containing oxygen are one of the most common free radicals and can lead to potential DNA damage and diseases including cancer, immune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. On the contrary, antioxidants prevent ROS damage by pairing the unpaired electrons in ROS before oxidation can occur. In fact, glutathione, the most common antioxidant, is found in high quantities in asparagus and avocado. Furthermore, past studies demonstrate that dental resin releases ROS; hence, dental resin can be used in experimentation to stimulate ROS growth. Additionally, due to the lack of access to advanced methods of observing DNA damage, the climbing abilities of fruit flies would be measured as an indirect indicator of DNA damage. Therefore, it was predicted that asparagus and avocado would improve the climbing abilities of fruit flies exposed to dental resin. Procedure: First, the fruit flies were split into four groups that were fed: regular fly medium; fly medium and dental resin (ROS-releasing component); fly medium, dental resin, and asparagus; and fly medium, dental resin, and avocado. Six vials were set up in each of the four groups using fly medium, water, yeast, dental resin, homemade avocado paste, and homemade asparagus paste (as needed). Next, live flies were transferred into a smaller test tube, which was then placed in the refrigerator to be sedated. Then, the flies were sorted by gender and five male and five female flies were placed into each vial. After setting up all 24 vials, the climbing assay or the percentage of flies that passed the climbing line (6 cm) in thirty seconds was measured. Three trials were conducted per vial every two days for six days (Day 2, 4, and 6). Results, Summary, and Conclusion: In total, the hypothesis of this research was proven partially true. According to the data collected on Day 6, the control group received an average score of 94.38%, the dental resin received an 82.00%, and the asparagus groups received a 90.63%. The lower dental resin scores confirmed that dental resin does release ROS leading to lower climbing percentages. Furthermore, the asparagus score was higher than the dental resin score showing that asparagus acts as an antioxidant by combating ROS. Additionally, an error bar analysis and T-test analysis were performed indicating a significant difference between the Control Group and Dental Resin, and the Dental Resin and Asparagus and confirming the credibility of this data. Unfortunately, no conclusions were made from the avocado groups because the thick avocado consistency stuck to the flies preventing them from climbing up the vial. Therefore, from this research, it can be concluded that asparagus does act as an effective antioxidant by combating ROS."
