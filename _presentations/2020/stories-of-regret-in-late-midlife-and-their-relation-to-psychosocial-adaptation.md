abstract: "Previous research indicates that regret is a painful experience for people but often leads to enhanced self meaning and personal growth. In this study, we employ a narrative approach to explore the architecture and coping methods of regret experiences in late midlife adults. We relate variation in regret narratives told by 163 adults aged 55 to 57 to psychosocial adaptation, conceptualized in terms of psychological well-being and Eriksonâ€™s adult-developmental factors of generativity and ego-integrity. Two coders analyzed interview transcripts of regret narratives for numerous content categories, including type of regret, source of regret, degree of resolution (coming to terms with, making peace with, solving the problem of) the regret, and hopefulness for the future. The qualitative results illustrate the diversity and richness of regret experiences in late midlife and flesh out the expression of 12 different coping methods for dealing with negative life experiences. The quantitative results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that degree of regret resolution is positively associated with overall psychosocial adaptation. Findings are discussed in terms of the role of the bidirectional relationship between regret resolution and psychosocial adaptation, as well as the role of regret experiences more generally in life stories and in late midlife development."
